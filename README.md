**Memory Module for Generative AI Simulation**


This project implements a Memory Module designed to manage and analyze daily, weekly, and monthly activities for various personas. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate detailed summaries and personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience by providing actionable insights based on historical activities.


The Memory Module tracks and stores activities for multiple personas, capturing the type of activity, location, and time period. For example, for persona 1 on 01-07-2024, activities might include going to the gym, having breakfast at home, and working at the university.

**Leveraging GPT-3.5-turbo**


**Summarization:** The module uses GPT-3.5-turbo to convert a list of activities into concise, coherent summaries. This helps in providing clear and readable overviews of what the personas have been doing over various periods.


**Recommendations:** By analyzing past activities, the AI can suggest new activities that align with the personasâ€™ preferences and routines.
