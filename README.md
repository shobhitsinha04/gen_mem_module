**Features**


**To track and store activities for multiple personas:** Log daily activities for multiple personas, ensuring comprehensive data management.

**To generate summaries of these activities over different periods (daily, weekly, and monthly):** Automatically generate daily, weekly, and monthly summaries using AI, providing a clear overview of activities.


**To provide personalized recommendations based on past activities:** Offer tailored recommendations by analyzing past activities and preferences. Access past activities based on specific criteria to understand patterns and behaviors.


**To manage memory by retaining important information and discarding less relevant data:** Efficiently delete less important memories based on a calculated importance score to maintain relevant data.

**Leveraging GPT-3.5-turbo**


**Summarization:** The module uses GPT-3.5-turbo to convert a list of activities into concise, coherent summaries. This helps in providing clear and readable overviews of what the personas have been doing over various periods.


**Recommendations:** By analyzing past activities, the AI can suggest new activities that align with the personasâ€™ preferences and routines.
